# Firebase Realtime Database with UITableView and UISearchController in swift 5.0
This app connect to Firebase Realtime Database and display dinamically all houses on a UITableView. 

There is also a search field and if a cell has been select then a new viewcontroller will be displayied 
with the website reference (given by firebase database)

I love work with Firebase because it's a platform that allow to modify the app in every moment, giving to the projects 
more flexibility and it is also easy.
Let me know if you want also other projects about Firebase usage.
